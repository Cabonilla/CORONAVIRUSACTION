This is a basic web page with basic information concerning the COVID-19 virus. It was written to be hosted on a server-less platform named [Itty Bitty Site](https://itty.bitty.site/edit). The service converts basic code into a format that loads via the address, which prevents such issues as server crashes.

V2: I ditched the serverless site, as it became too much of a hassle to link them. Available links are still available. Added a few simple videos and a call to action.

V3: Made the web UI more user friendly. Still the same general information, just formatted differently. The UI is a template from somewhere, stripped the excess, and added the information. Pretty simple.

**Required languages**: HTML, CSS, JS

# What I Learned
